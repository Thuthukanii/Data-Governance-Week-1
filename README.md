<summary>From Data to Insight</summary>
<br>

Creating, collecting, and storing data without a clear purpose is wasteful.

Exceptions exist, but generally, data should serve a purpose.

Unused data is as useless as unread reports; data must be converted into information to be meaningful.

Information organizes and contextualizes data, making it useful on its own.

Information, when coupled with broader concepts, becomes knowledge, which is actionable.

Knowledge, when combined with reasoning and experience, leads to wisdom.

Wisdom determines the contextual validity of knowledge and guides actions.

Insight, derived from knowledge and wisdom, provides a deeper understanding.

Examples illustrate the progression from data to insight using Harry Styles.

The data-information-knowledge-wisdom (DIKW) hierarchy depicts the journey from data to insight.

<summary>The Lifecycle of Data</summary>
<br>

![img_1.png](img_1.png)

Creation:  This is the stage at which data comes into being. It may be manual or automated and get created internally or externally. Data is created all the time by a vast number of activities that include system inputs and outputs.

Storage:  Once data is created and assuming you want it available for later use, it must be stored. It most likely will be contained and managed in a database. The database needs a home, too as a local hard drive, server, or cloud service.

Usage:  Hopefully you’re capturing and storing data because you want to use it. Maybe not immediately, but at some point, perhaps for analysis. Data may need to be processed to be useful. That could include cleansing it of errors, transforming it to another format, and securing access rights.

Archival:  In this stage, you identify data that is not currently being used and move it to a long-term storage system out of your production environment. If it's needed at some point in the future, it can be retrieved and utilized.

Destruction:  Despite a desire by some to keep everything forever, there is a logical point where destruction makes sense or is required by regulation or policy. Data destruction involves making data inaccessible and unreadable. It can include the physical destruction of a device such as a hard drive.

<summary>Understanding the Impact of Big Data</summary>
<br>

Data isn’t some kind of new phenomenon. In fact, we’ve been capturing and storing data in an analog fashion for thousands of years. The Romans, for example, used ledgers to keep track of their various activities across their expansive empire.

Fast-forward to the 20th century and the Cold War was instrumental in the technological leaps that resulted in microprocessors and the classical computing we use today. 
One by-product of the Cold War, the space race between the United States and the Soviet Union, accelerated innovation in computing and telecommunications.

The U.S. Census played a crucial role in the development of data processing, originating in the late 1800s to tabulate population data every ten years.

The Tabulating Machine Company, later known as IBM, automated and commercialized data processing through punch cards, which represented data points like gender.

IBM's advancements in data processing expanded into various sectors, including office automation, military, academia, and factories.

These developments marked the transition into the information age, characterized by the proliferation of data as a raw material driving productivity and innovation.

Connectivity facilitated the free flow of information across devices, organizations, and geographies, leading to explosive growth in data creation, storage, and utilization.

The significant increase in data volume and velocity led to the emergence of "big data," reflecting the scale and challenge of managing vast amounts of data effectively.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Defining Big Data</summary>
<br>

One way to define and characterize big data is through these five Vs:

Volume: The sheer scale of data being produced is unprecedented and requires new tools, skills, and processes.

Variety: There are already a lot of legacy file formats, such as CSV and MP3, and with new innovations, new formats are emerging all the time. This requires different methods of handling, from analysis to security.

Velocity: With so many collection points, digital interfaces, and ubiquitous connectivity, data is being created and moved at increasing speed. Consider that in 2021, Instagram users created, uploaded, and share 65,000 pictures a minute.

Variability:  The fact that the creation and flow of data are unpredictable.

Veracity:  The quality, including accuracy and truthfulness, of large volume of disparate sets of data, can differ considerably, causing challenges to data management.

**Drivers of Big Data**

Big data has been a significant phenomenon preceding the era of smartphones and the Internet of Things (IoT), characterized by an explosion in data creation, storage, and utilization.

The volume of data has experienced exponential growth, with global technology use generating 79 zettabytes in 2021, expected to reach 180 zettabytes by 2025.

Despite its impressive scale, much of the data is unstructured, duplicative, or of poor quality, presenting challenges for analysis and accessibility.

Despite challenges, big data provides immense value to organizations, driving innovation and facilitating advancements like self-driving cars and optimized supply chains.

Big data enables organizations to make more informed decisions, especially in marketing, by targeting specific audiences and individuals effectively.

While big data receives significant attention, small data sets, such as spreadsheets and surveys, remain valuable for decision-making and daily operations.

Smart data has emerged as a term describing big data that has been optimized for specific uses, employing processes like artificial intelligence (AI) to extract relevant insights.

Data governance is essential for all forms of data, whether big, small, or smart, emphasizing the importance of managing data effectively in the 21st century.
